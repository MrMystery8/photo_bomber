## Implementation Notes

The UI overhaul maintains all existing functionality while providing a significantly improved user experience with a modern, accessible design. All changes have been integrated directly into the existing files:

1. `static/theme.css` - Updated design tokens and component styles
2. `static/style.css` - Updated layout and screen-specific styles
3. `templates/index.html` - Updated HTML template with new UI structure
4. `COPY_DECK.md` - Complete copy deck for all UI text

The application can be run as before with `python app.py` and will now use the new UI.
